    rdfs:comment "This is a core Origraph expertise area that can both save a lot of money over time, as well as ensure a higher-quality result that actually meets your needs. Designing for incorrect tasks and/or poor data schemas are often the most significant risk in data projects [@nested_model_2009; @dsm_2012]—taking the time to make sure that we're doing the right thing is always worth the investment." .

    rdfs:comment "Revisiting business objectives, data sources, and user needs on a regular basis (typically quarterly) is strongly recommended. Beyond the broadly-scoped initial assessment, subsequent reports will include qualitative and quantitative metadata about the state of your data, and are likely to paint a much richer picture with more specific actionable insights, and uncover more blind spots." ;
