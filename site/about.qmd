# There are more ways to organize data than rows and columns

The short 50ish years of modern personal computing are a tiny blip in history, and computing still has a long way to go, when it comes to augmenting human thinking abilities.

So far, the only universal ways that computers allow non-developers to organize information are:

1. text documents,
2. images, or
3. spreadsheets.

But people rarely color strictly within those rigid constraints.

## Hierarchies are everywhere



From organization charts, to recipies, to the last bulleted outline that you made, hierarchical structures are older than writing itself—most social animals use them, and understand them intimately.

- todo: When it gets big / messy: manufacturing, recipies, what kinds of questions we'd LIKE to ask

- todo: ... but we're doing data analysis in Word??? or folders?


## Networks aren't just for conspiracy theories

Even if you've never heard the word "graph" as a synonym for "network," Hollywood is already comfortable showing you boards of pins and red string with zero explanation.

- todo: hierarchies are arguably just a type of network; so those questions plus more (genealogy, kevin bacon)

- todo: ... but pins and red string are the state of the art

## You're already a set theorist / ontologist

Are hot dogs a type of sandwich?

Is a waffle just a dessert pizza?

[Is butt legs](https://youtu.be/RHKGWLml_mg?feature=shared)?

What makes a **true** Scotsman?

- todo: Fallacious appeals to authority aside, categorizing things into groups matter a lot for how science / society work

- todo: ... but our best tools for organizing, communicating, and debating that kind of information are... hand-drawn Venns, or argumentative walls of text

## High school algebra wasn't for nothing

If you vageuly remember what $y=mx+c$ means, you're already most of the way there when it comes to understanding vectors, regression, and Machine Learning / AI.

There are some extra words you may not know for things that you're already seen:

A **vector** is just a fancy word for a point that you'd see in a scatterplot:

todo

They can have as many **dimensions** as you'd like:

todo

... but for our brains that are used to thinking in 2, 3 (or *maybe* 4) dimensions, it helps to **project** those points into just a few at a time, like looking at the different shadows that a 3D object casts on a 2D wall:

todo: scatterplot matrix

**Cluster** todo

**Regression** todo

- ... but vectors, clusters, regressions, projections—but actually using your intuition and your high school skills aren't things that software lets you do.
