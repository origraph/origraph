Origraph is a work-in-progress data editor, that we hope to release under an open source license in the coming months.

Want better, free data LEGOs sooner?

# There are more ways to organize data than rows and columns

The short 50ish years of modern personal computing are a tiny blip in history, and computing still has a long way to go, when it comes to augmenting human thinking abilities.

So far, the only universal ways that computers allow non-developers to organize information are:

1. text documents,
2. images, or
3. spreadsheets.

But people rarely color strictly within those rigid constraints.

### Low-hanging fruit

Origraph is focusing on other [**data abstractions**]{.teal .accent}—the cool LEGOs that the computer science nerds have been hoarding all this time—that most people already intuitively understand.

Yes, when we've finally achieved an MVP app, you'll still get the rows and columns that you know from spreadsheets, images, and unstructured / semi-structured text documents. But you'll also be more free to [**reshape**]{.pink .accent} that information as hierarchies, networks, sets, and vectors.

## Hierarchies

**Hierarchies are everywhere.**

From organization charts, to recipies, to the last bulleted outline that you made, hierarchical structures are older than writing itself—most social animals use them, and understand them intimately.

- todo: When it gets big / messy: manufacturing, recipies, what kinds of questions we'd LIKE to ask

- todo: ... but we're doing data analysis in Word??? or folders?


## Networks

**Networks aren't just for conspiracy theories.**

Even if you've never heard the word "graph" as a synonym for "network," Hollywood is already comfortable showing you boards of pins and red string with zero explanation.

- todo: hierarchies are arguably just a type of network; so those questions plus more (genealogy, kevin bacon)

- todo: ... but pins and red string are the state of the art

## Sets

**You're already a set theorist / ontologist.**

Are hot dogs a type of sandwich?

Is a waffle just a dessert pizza?

[Is butt legs](https://youtu.be/RHKGWLml_mg?feature=shared)?

Fallacious "true Scotsman" appeals to authority aside, categorizing things into groups—math nerds often use the word "sets"—matters a lot for how science, business, and society work.

Whether you're trying to understand [why some chestnut trees are more similar to Broccoli than each other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5msNfrYeKk), how menu placement might be impacting your restaurant's sales, or [how being put in one category versus another can be a life-or-death decision](https://doi.org/10.7551/mitpress/6352.001.0001): [**good categories matter.**]{.orange .accent}

But nobody's perfect when we create. Getting creative about good categories, and revising bad ones, requires the freedom to edit.

Our best software tools for organizing, communicating, and debating about set relationships are ... hand-drawn Venn diagrams, or argumentative walls of Reddit text.


- todo: ... but our best tools for organizing, communicating, and debating that kind of information are... hand-drawn Venns, or argumentative walls of text

## Vectors

**You probably endured High School algebra, ... but never get to use it.**

If you vageuly remember what $y=mx+c$ means, you're already most of the way there when it comes to understanding vectors, regression, and Machine Learning / AI.

There are some extra words you may not know for things that you're already seen:

A **vector** is just a fancy word for a point that you'd see in a scatterplot:

todo

They can have as many **dimensions** as you'd like:

todo

... but for our brains that are used to thinking in 2, 3 (or *maybe* 4) dimensions, it helps to **project** those points into just a couple dimensions at a time, like looking at 2D shadows of a 3D (or $n$-D) object, from different angles:

todo: scatterplot matrix

**Cluster** todo

**Regression** todo

- ... but vectors, clusters, regressions, projections—but actually using your intuition and your high school skills aren't things that software lets you do.
