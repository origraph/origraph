## App under construction

Origraph is not-yet-released visual data wrangling environment, that we hope to release under an open source license in the coming year.

Origraph represents a whole new way to visually [**edit**]{.purple .accent}, [**model**]{.teal .accent}, [**analyze**]{.green .accent}, [**visualize**]{.pink .accent}, and [**train / use AI**]{.yellow .accent} in ways that respect and augment human creativity, rather than attempting to replace it.

<!-- [About the app](about.qmd){.origraph-button .pink style="display:inline-block"} -->

You can find the precursor academic proof-of-concept—exploring visual [**modeling**]{.teal .accent} possibilities for network data—at [https://origraph.github.io](https://origraph.github.io).

Want a richer set of data building blocks sooner?

# There are more ways to organize data than rows and columns

The short 50ish years of modern personal computing are a tiny blip in history, and computing still has a long way to go, when it comes to augmenting human thinking abilities.

So far, the only universal ways that computers allow non-developers to organize information are:

1. text documents,
2. images, or
3. spreadsheets.

But people rarely think about or organize information, strictly within those rigid constraints.

### Low-hanging fruit

Origraph is focusing on other [**data abstractions**]{.teal .accent}—cool LEGOs that the computer science nerds have been hoarding all this time inside programming languages—that most people already intuitively understand.

Yes, when we've finally achieved an MVP app, you'll still have the rows and columns that you know from spreadsheets, the pixels you know from images, and the text in unstructured / semi-structured documents. But you'll also be more free to [**reshape**]{.pink .accent} that information as hierarchies, networks, sets, and vectors.

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Hierarchies

**Hierarchies are everywhere.**

From organization charts, to recipe ingredient lists, to the last bulleted outline that you made, hierarchical structures are older than writing itself—most social animals use them, and understand them intimately.

- todo: When it gets big / messy: manufacturing, recipies, what kinds of questions we'd LIKE to ask

- todo: ... people are stuck doing hierarchical data analysis in ... Word??? or OS folders? at best

## Networks

**Networks aren't just for conspiracy theories.**

Even if you've never heard the word "graph" as a synonym for "network," Hollywood is already comfortable showing you boards of pins and red string with zero explanation.

- todo: hierarchies are arguably just a type of network; so those questions plus more (genealogy, kevin bacon)

- todo: ... but physical pins and red string are the state of the art; still missing an app focused on editing network data

## Sets

**You're already a set theorist / ontologist.**

Are hot dogs a type of sandwich?

Is a waffle just a dessert pizza?

[Is butt legs](https://youtu.be/RHKGWLml_mg?feature=shared)?

Fallacious "true Scotsman" appeals to authority aside, categorizing things into groups—math nerds often use the word "sets"—matters a lot for how science, business, and society work.

Whether you're trying to understand [why some chestnut trees are more similar to Broccoli than each other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5msNfrYeKk), how menu placement might be impacting your restaurant's sales, or [how being put in one category versus another can be a life-or-death decision](https://doi.org/10.7551/mitpress/6352.001.0001): [**good categories matter.**]{.orange .accent}

But nobody's perfect, especially when we're working with data. Getting creative about good categories, and revising bad ones, requires the freedom to edit.

The state of the art for organizing, communicating, and debating about set relationships are ... boolean spreadsheets (cells are a 1 or a 0) that you can visualize with UpSet&nbsp;[@2014_infovis_upset], hand-drawn Venn diagrams, or argumentative walls of Reddit text.

We're still missing an app focused on **editing** and **modeling** data from the perspective of set relationships.

## Vectors

**You probably endured High School algebra, ... but never get to use it.**

If you vageuly remember what $y=mx+c$ means, you're already most of the way there when it comes to understanding vectors, regression, and Machine Learning / AI.

There are some extra words you may not know for things that you're already seen:

A **vector** is just a fancy word for a point that you'd see in a scatterplot:

todo

They can have as many **dimensions** as you'd like:

todo

... but for our brains that are used to thinking in 2, 3 (or *maybe* 4) dimensions, it helps to **project** those points into just a couple dimensions at a time, like looking at 2D shadows of a 3D (or $n$-D) object, from different angles:

todo: scatterplot matrix

**Cluster** todo

**Regression** todo

- ... but vectors, clusters, regressions, projections—but actually using your intuition and your high school skills aren't things that software lets you do.
