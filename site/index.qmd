## [App under construction]{.orange .accent}

Origraph is not-yet-released visual data wrangling environment.

A richer set of data LEGOs—beyond mere rows and columns—are coming, for Excel-level data workers in a post-AI world.

Origraph represents a whole new way to visually [**edit**]{.purple .accent}, [**model**]{.teal .accent}, [**analyze**]{.green .accent}, [**visualize**]{.pink .accent}, and [**train / use AI**]{.yellow .accent} in ways that respect and augment human creativity, rather than attempting to replace it.

<!-- [About the app](about.qmd){.origraph-button .pink style="display:inline-block"} -->

You can find the precursor academic proof-of-concept—exploring visual [**modeling**]{.teal .accent} possibilities for network data—at [https://origraph.github.io](https://origraph.github.io).

## Humans still have (unsupported) data superpowers

At Origraph, we believe that natural human curiosity should be all that you need to ask deep, insightful questions about your data. [**Creativity is fundamental to good data science**]{.pink .accent}—including what information you choose to collect, how you organize and model it, and the kinds of questions that you dare to ask about it.

However, modern visual computing is less than a century old. We're still in the dark ages, w.r.t. all the ways that software can (or could) satisfy human curiosity, and how to facilitate thinking outside of the box. Despite universal understanding—zero explanation needed—of "advanced" data concepts like pins-and-red-string graphs in movies, the set theory that comes naturally to anyone looking at a Venn diagram, or the ability to craft sophisticated arguments about ontological problems like whether a hot dog is a sandwich; [**we're still missing the basic UX for working with non-tabular data**]{.orange .accent}.

Search engines, AI, and spreadsheets are ubiquitous. But if you want to ask more expressive questions than they can understand; if you want to color outside of the lines of tables; or go beyond guess-and-check prompt engineering; [**existing software still gatekeeps the fun side of data science**]{.yellow .accent} by demanding artificial requirements like programming experience and/or a PhD in data science to play with any other data shapes.

## Get ahead of the post-AI aftermath

If you're smart enough to see past the hype—to the limits of what AI can or should do—you already understand that [**human creativity is the most important digital skill of the future**]{.teal .accent}.

While your competitors are busy with the blunder of trying to outsource all the work of their most creative employees to expensive, hallucinating chatbots, we offer:

[Consulting services](consulting.qmd){.origraph-button .yellow style="display:inline-block"}

for how to best empower the human data workers in your organization with data that you already have, and how to plan for the creative data-based thinking that you will need in the future.
