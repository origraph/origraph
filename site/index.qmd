## Got a gnarly spreadsheet?

Even without any training, people often do **more sophisticated** data things, than what the basic rows and columns of spreadsheets were designed to handle.

Unfortunately, we still live in a software world in which—***for now***—playing with non-tabular data is the exclusive privilege of programmers and big corporations. At Origraph, we specialize in helping people find, use, or create software that organizes information in a way that's **compatible with your mental model**.

Whether it's an advanced visualization, a knowledge graph, a NoSQL database, or statistics & AI, check out our [![Consulting icon](/logos/ui/headset.svg){.origraph-icon} Consulting Services](blog/consulting.qmd){.origraph-button .yellow style="display:inline-block"} for how to best empower the people who manage information in your organization, with the data that you already have, and how to plan for the **creative data thinking** that you will need in the post-AI world.

# App under construction
Origraph itself is not-yet-released visual data wrangling environment.

A richer set of data building blocks—beyond mere rows and columns—are coming, for Excel-level data workers in a post-AI world.

Origraph represents a whole new way to visually [**edit**]{.purple}, [**model**]{.teal}, [**analyze**]{.green}, [**visualize**]{.pink}, and [**train / use AI**]{.yellow} in ways that respect and augment human creativity, rather than attempting to replace it.

You can find a precursor academic proof-of-concept—exploring [**visual modeling**]{.teal} possibilities for network data—at [https://origraph.github.io](https://origraph.github.io){.teal}.

### An expanded data toy box for the mind

Search engines, AI, and spreadsheets are ubiquitous. But if you want to ask more expressive questions than those tools were designed for; if you want to color outside of the lines of tables; or go beyond guess-and-check prompt engineering; existing software still gatekeeps [**the fun side of data science**]{.orange .accent} by demanding artificial requirements like programming experience, a PhD in data science, and/or a budget for an entire software team, just to play with any non-tabular data shapes.
