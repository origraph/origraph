# Informal roadmap for non-lawyers

_This section is neither legal advice, nor should this be construed to contain legally enforceable binding statements_

If you clone or otherwise copy our code at this point, yes, that's a violation of our copyright, and you do so at your own risk.

The extent to which we you are conscientiously contributing (as defined per our sole discretion) to a community around this app will have a lot to do with whether we care about doing anything about any copyright violations.

If you're thinking about contributing... that alone may be enough motivation to make us wind up our "what's the best way forward?" research (see below), and pick a license. Let us know, and this document can go away.

**_TL;DR_**: We're in the early stages of everything; we don't have a perfect picture of the best way forward; everything is messy; **_please just talk to us_**.

## Rationale: why is this even public?

This tool (and its corresponding business / sustainability model) are works in progress.

Releasing proprietary code like this is probably a bad decision from a hyper-capitalist perspective, but ... (expletive) that.

Although we haven't settled on an open source license, we're already needing to reuse bits of this code for fully-proprietary projects, under non-exclusive licenses—so we're posting incomplete code now in order to document and protect our right to give it away for free in the future.

We believe that community and transparency should always come before profit, and as we get closer to an MVP, we plan to release our core app and its code (at the very least) under _some kind of_ free / open source license.

However, the specific license(s?) that will be most appropriate for:

1. the app itself,
2. the planned browser extension,
3. any component / utility libraries,
4. documentation, and
5. demo datasets

... is still unclear, and those things might end up needing different licenses. The true market for Origraph still feels way too broad to commit to a specific license at this point. _Sustainable_ open source development is far from a solved problem, seems to be very context-dependent, ... and the context for this app's funding is really fuzzy right now.

# We need data.

If you're reading this file, we want to know what you think about the best way forward. [Please contact us!](mailto:info@origraph.net) to let us know what you'd like to see us do, what license(s) you'd prefer we use, etc.

We can't promise to make everyone happy, but the reason we haven't picked a license yet is that we'd like to avoid premature, uninformed licensing / business modeling decisions that end up hurting the app more than they help.
